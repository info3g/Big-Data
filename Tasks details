HIVE PROJECT 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project aims to display Beverages-to-Multiple Branches of one Coffee Shop (many-to-many relation) using Hive. In other words, each Beverage might be available on many

Branches, and each Branch of the Coffee shop might distribute many Beverages.

Assuming each branch send their sales report as a csv file. The project aims to stage them to HDFS and further analysis to be performed using Hive for the given problem statement below.

The description of the data is as below
Beverages Name does not have spaces.
Coffee shop Branches have mentioned as Branch1, Branch2 and etc.

Beverages can be ordered many times, with different counts
A Beverage and Branch combination might appear multiple times
Beverages could be available on multiple Branches

The output should have no commas or punctuation, only 1 space between the
Beverages and Count of Consumed people.


INPUT FILES

PROBLEM STATEMENT

What is the total number of consumers for Branch1?

What is the number of consumers for the Branch2?
What is the most consumed beverage on Branch1?
What are the beverages available on Branch10, Branch8, and Branch1?

HIVE PROJECT

Placing the given dataset in HDFS

Create directory in HDFS

Step 1: Before creating directories in HDFS, ensure all the daemons in hadoop are started.
The below code is for creating directory called “projinput” as follows,

$ hadoop fs -mkdir /user/hive/projinput

Placing the input files in the HDFS directory

Step 1: Copying all the given dataset files from local to HDFS directory in a separate directory. The code as follows,

$ hadoop fs -copyFromLocal Bev_BranchA.txt /user/hive/projinput/Bev_BranchA.txt $ hadoop fs -copyFromLocal Bev_BranchB.txt /user/hive/projinput/Bev_BranchB.txt $ hadoop fs -copyFromLocal Bev_BranchC.txt /user/hive/projinput/Bev_BranchC.txt

$ hadoop fs -copyFromLocal Bev_ConscountA.txt /user/hive/projinput/Bev_ConscountA.txt $ hadoop fs -copyFromLocal Bev_ConscountB.txt /user/hive/projinput/Bev_ConscountB.txt $ hadoop fs -copyFromLocal Bev_ConscountC.txt /user/hive/projinput/Bev_ConscountC.txt


Step 2: After the Step 1, check whether the files got placed in the HDFS in browser.


Implementation in HIVE

Creating HIVE DB

Step 1: Create a database in the name “hadoophiveproj” in HIVE. The code as follows,

Hive> create database if not exits hadoophiveproj with dbproperties(‘creator’=’Haripriya’,’date’=’15/10/2017’);

Creating & Loading the HIVE tables with the given datasets

Step 1: Create separate raw tables for the Beverages-Counsumercount different datasets each in “hadoophiveproj” database. The given file (Bev_Conscount *.txt) consist of
<Beverages, Consumercount> (A Beverage and the number of consumers).

Example Bev_Conscount*.txt:
